### Demo

A live demo can be found [here](https://jrie.github.io/sqDropdown/).

### Usage
See `index.html` for details on how to setup the items. Or read on.

In short, create a `select` element or elements with a base option structure, like you would do normally. You can also use `selected` options.

Add the class `sqDropdown` to the `select` element or elements.

Now include the `css` and `js` code which you like to use, either the regular or the minified version. The `index.html` shows the unminified setup. After the css class is added and the script is loaded, the magic will appear.

Reload the page and check out the nicely put dropdowns.
